            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Robots Will Steal Our Jobs, But They'll Give Us New Ones</h1><p>At the Dusseldorf airport, robotic valet parking is now reality. You step out of your car. You press a button on a touch screen. And then a machine lifts your car off the ground, moving all three tons of it into a kind of aerial parking bay.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/50eeb4584eaaa7b0dc7949e53e992badfb0a34ce.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Philosophical Argument Against A.I. Killing Us All</h1><p>Some people think A.I. will kill us off. In his 2014 book Superintelligence , Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom offers several doomsday scenarios. One is that an A.I. might "tile all of the Earth's surface with solar panels, nuclear reactors, supercomputing facilities with protruding cooling towers, space rocket launchers, or other installations whereby the AI intends to maximize the long-term cumulative realization of its values."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4095854d45b1395ed4f2153286c796e57557f54a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google's Artificial Intelligence Speaks, and She's a Woman</h1><p>Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author, and all around academic bad ass. There's no doubt in my mind that he's one of the smartest human beings to ever exist. You already knew that though. What you maybe didn't know is that he's incredibly wary of artificial intelligence (AI).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1054cbc5cfe4402580fbbddf46098cfc93a3cf06.jpg"></article>]]></description>
