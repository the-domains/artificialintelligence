            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Robots Will Steal Our Jobs, But They'll Give Us New Ones</h1><p>At the Dusseldorf airport, robotic valet parking is now reality. You step out of your car. You press a button on a touch screen. And then a machine lifts your car off the ground, moving all three tons of it into a kind of aerial parking bay.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/50eeb4584eaaa7b0dc7949e53e992badfb0a34ce.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>App-Improvement AI And The Future Of Web Development</h1><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is permeating our lives - just not in the ways we might have expected from reading sci-fi novels or watching robot apocalypse-themed movies. Instead of having live robots walking around, doing our dishes and engaging us in conversation, AI exists primarily in web and mobile apps designed to help us with small intellectual chores, like finding out when the Civil War began or where the nearest taco restaurant is located.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6f1a4d3f8ad0251a348d74510030f4a30e405291.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Could artificial intelligence lose its mind?</h1><p>Google's DeepDream provides an unsettling glimpse of a machine's "thinking." Leonid Bershidsky, Bloomberg&nbsp|&nbsp26 July 2015&nbsp14:20 The DeepDream algorithm Google made public this month is a strange offshoot of image recognition technology based on artificial intelligence. It can turn mundane images into hallucinatory worlds, and has spawned sites where you can have photos processed with the software and even a mobile app.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4f52d510073b485caab9c7c1998419213d478719.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Machine Intelligence In The Real World</h1><p>I've been laser-focused on machine intelligence in the past few years. I've talked to hundreds of entrepreneurs, researchers and investors about helping machines make us smarter. In the months since I shared my landscape of machine intelligence companies, folks keep asking me what I think of them - as if they're all doing more or less the same thing.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5de2b4c1b36810971f0dedf367ac4c733893a0c0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
