      As the Pepper robot f rom Softbank scurries about your home or office, it
      reads your emotions by your words, tone of voice, facial expressions, and
      body language. It then responds in all those ways; its hands and posture
      in particular are remarkably expressive.

  of your car. You press a button on a touch screen. And then a machine lifts
  your car off the ground, moving all three tons of it into a kind of aerial
  parking bay.
