    description: 'Enterprise software is about to undergo radical transformation - a substantial change that will make the shift to software as a service (SaaS) look like a simple facelift. This transformation is being powered by machine learning. With machine learning, computers can process and mine data in real time to automatically discover insights and generate predictive models.'

description: 'Humans may take months to develop predictive algorithms for big-data analysis Data Science Machine would eliminate human intuition but cut time out of the process, completing the same tasks in a matter of hours Machine outperformed over 600 human teams in three competitions Computers could soon replace human intuition in many areas - and a new system developed at MIT has shown it can outperform even the smartest of people.'
