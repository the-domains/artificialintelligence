  Tom Murphy graduated from Carnegie Melon University with a PhD in computer
  science. Then he built software that learned to play Nintendo games. In some
  cases, the system works well. Playing Super Mario, for instance, it learns to
  exploit a bug in the game, stomping on enemy Goombas even when floating below
  them.
